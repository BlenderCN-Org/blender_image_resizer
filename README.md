##Blender Image Resizer

######An image resizer addon for blender. Easily resize your images in blender.


#####It needs the [Pillow(PIL)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow) python module.


####How to install Pillow to Blender?
If your system's python version matches with blender's python version,

(To find blender's python version, switch to python console in blender and type these commands.)

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.version
    '3.5.1 (default, Jun  7 2016, 02:56:20) \n[GCC 5.3.0]'
    
(means, version = 3.5.1)

If pillow is not installed, first install it with;

```pip install -U pillow```

to your system's python.

And then, you can just copy the "PIL" directory form your system's python's site-packages directory
to blender's python's site-packages directory. :)
